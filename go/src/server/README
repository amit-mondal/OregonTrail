Basic Server Functionality:

Clients should register prior to game start with a POST to /register
Here is a sample JSON:

{  
   "id":"bill",
   "location":{  
      "lat":1.1,
      "lon":2.1
   }
}

IMPORTANT: Note that lat and lon fields are no longer strings
The response code should be 200 if successful

Once all clients are registered, a GET to /start will start the game.

Once the game is started, clients can POST to /checkin with the same kind of JSON they used to register.
A response from checkin will look like this:

{  
   "percent_complete":0,
   "event":-1,
   "event_client":"",
   "client":{  
      "id":"bill",
      "location":{  
         "lat":1.1,
         "lon":2.1
      },
      "is_alive":false,
      "food":5,
      "water":2,
      "bullets":10,
      "supplies":5
   }
}

The first field is the percent of the game the party has completed.
The second is the event ID. Check events.go to see which event ID corresponds to which event. An event ID of -1 means there is no event.
The third is the ID of the client to whom the event will occur. All events affect one client except for visiting a town, which affects all clients.
The fourth is simply the client's information.

THe client should keep checking in periodically (about once every 2 or 3 seconds) until an event occurs.
Once an event occurs, the client should serve the event to the user and give them the chance to respond. Clients can no longer check in while there
is a pending event.

The first client to send a GET to /respond/{clientid} will be the responder to the event. Once the event has been responded to by a client, checking in
will work as normal. Thus, every client should keep trying to check in during the event to see if another client has already responded to the event.
